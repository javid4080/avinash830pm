When using EC2, No need to predict future usage.. 

capital expenditure: Guess all the future use and build.. ROI not immedete.. 
Operational expenditure: Cost to manage the resources.. 

Need a Server :

How to launch our first Instance (Windows)

On-Demand EC2 Instances : When we don't have idea on workloads.. No PRedictable usage.. If you want to test your application for the first time.. 
Pricing : /Sec billing (With Min of 60 Sec)

Reserved Instances : Predictable usage.. Stable workloads.. We will get these instance for the duration of 1 Year / 3 Years.. In contract with AWS.. 

	--> Standard RI : We cannot change the configuration..  
	--> Convertable RI : We can change the configuration.. 
	--> Scheduled RI : Repeaded / Persistant usage.. 

Pricing : --> Full Upfront : 100% while purchasing instance
	  --> Partial Upfront : Pay 30-50% now.. Remaining Monthly basis.. 
	  --> No Upfront : No need to pay anything now.. Pay Monthly basis.. 

Spot Instances : If our application have flexible start and stop times, We can go with spot instances.. We can get high configuration servers at low cost.. 

1 Hr 30 Min : If price increased, AWS terminates the instance and we will get charged for full/completed hours, not for partial hours.. : 1 Hr.. 

1 Hr 30 Min : If price not increased, you terminates the instance and we will get charged for full duration, Included partial hours also.. : 1 Hr 30 Min.. 

We can use Pricing history, We can create a spot fleet also.. 


How to Launch an EC2 Instance..!!!

Step 1 : CHoose an AMI (An AMI is a template that contains the software configuration (operating system, application server, and applications) required to launch your instance.)

Os : Linux (Amazon Linux, Ubuntu, Redhat, Fedora, CentoS, Kali linux), Windows (2019,2016,2012/ 2012 r2)

Step 2 : Choose the Instance Type (Choosing the configuration : vCPU, Memory, Network)

General Purpose : Stable performance for all resources 	: t2, t3, m5, m5d
Compute optimized : Gives best Compute CPU power 	: C4, C5, C5d
GPU instances : Graphic utilisation 			: P2, g4dn
Memory optimized : More RAM/Memory performance		: r4, r5, r5a, r5ad, x1
Storage optimized : Disk performance / IOPS 		: i2, i3, d2

c5.2xlarge	--> 8vCPU and 16 RAM, Up to 10 Gigabit

T2.micro --> Only instance comes under free tier eligibility



Windows : RDP : Remote Desktop Protocol : 3389 : 0.0.0.0/0
Linux : SSH : Secure shell : 22 : 


KeyPair : 


Task : Launch a Windows ec2 instance (Choose t2.micro)

Task 2 : Change the Default password, and try to login using the keypair generated password and changed password. Test which one is working. 

Task 3 : Create a new user in Windows OS and Provide remote connection permissions and try to login and verify his access. --> Provide local admin rights for newly created user.

Free Tier : 750 Hours, t2.micro Windows Instance.. 
750 Hours, t2.micro Linux Instance.. 


Step 1: Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) : Amazon Linux

Step 2: Choose an Instance Type : t2.micro

Step 3: Configure Instance Details

No of instances : 1	(In a region we can have 20 Running instances)
Shutdown behavior : STOP

Stop : We can start at any time
Terminate : Delete.. 

Enable termination protection : Extra step to terminate the instance. It eliminates accidental terminations.

Monitoring : Cloudwatch.. Enabled by defaultly..

Basic Monitoring : 5 Min  : Free
Detailed / Enhanced Monitoring : 1 Min : Cost us

Tenancy : 
--> Shared Tenancy : Same hardware for multiple customers (Free Tier)
--> Dedicated Tanancy : Dedicated hardware for your AWS account. Hardware will not share with another customers.
	--> Dedicated Instance : 
	--> Dedicated Host : 

T2/T3 Unlimited : Addes the General purpose resources autimatically based on the usage. 


Step 4: Add Storage

Don't choose more than 30 GB

Step 5: Add Tags.. We can define our own metadata.. Key and Value
We can add max of 50 Tags/Instance.. 

Step 6: Configure Security Group

As we are launching Linux instance, PORT 22 Must be opened, THen only we can connect to this instance.. 

Anywhere : 0.0.0.0/0 : 
My IP : Picks currently connected network's public IP


How to connect to a Linux INstance : 
--> Putty
--> Windows OS, We can use command prompt by installing openssh. 
--> MobaXterm


Putty Needs the private key in .ppk format. It will not support .pem format.

We need to convert .pem to .ppk.. PuttyGen

ssh -i keypair.pem username@publicip

If it is giving badpermissions error.. 
chmod 400 Keypairname

Storage : 

--> Block based Storage : Designed to run OS
--> 2 Root Device Types
	--> EBS (Elastic Block Storage) VOlumes : We can stop/start. We will not loss any data if underlying hardware failure happens. 
	--> Instance Store Volumes / EPhemeral Storage : We cannot stop / start the instances. If underlying hardware failure happens, we will loss all data.. We refers it also as Ephemeral Storage.
Instance store will not support all the instance and AMI types. NO FREE TIER..We can reboot if required..  

Use NetAPP tools to convert an Instance store volume to EBS Volume.


EBS Volumes : 

General Purpose (SSD) : GP2 : Min 1 Gb, Max 16 TB.. Dev/test, Boot volume, Balanced performance.. Max : 16,000 IOPS...    1 GB = 3 IOPS with Min of 100 IOPS.. 

Provisioned IOPS (SSD) : io1 : Min 4 Gb, Max 16 TB.. I/O intensive applicagtions, Any database on Instance, NoSQL.. Highest performance.. Max IOPS : 64,000.. 
1 GB  = 50 IOPS.. We can specify our required IOPS count.. 

Magnetic (Standard) : Standard : Min 1 Gb, Max 1 TB.. Standard performance.. Lowest cost.. 

Throughput optimised (HDD) : st1 : Min 500 GB, Max 16 TB.. BigData applications.. Datawarehousings.. Log Processings.. Max : 500 IOPS.. THroughput : 500 MB/s.. 

Cold HDD : sc1 : Min 500 GB, Max 16 TB.. Low cost HDD.. Less Frequently accesed data.. Only fewer scans per day on data.. 

root : Boot Volume : GP2, Io1 and Magnetic

IOPS : Input and Output per second


Snapshot : Backup of an EBS volume called as Snapshot.. 

Practice Snapshot with Same region ec2 instance.. 

Read EBS volumes comparison chart.. 

aws.amazon.com/ebs.. FAQs

_________________________________________________________________________________________

D: 09/03/2020

DLM : Data LifyCycle Manager : Automate the Snapshot creation process.. 


Snapshots : Where AWS is storing these snapshots : Amazon's own S3 Platform.. 

--> We can create a volume in same Region.. / Copy SS to Another Region .. /Share SS with ANotyher AWS account / Share snapshot with public.. 


Windows : IIS : 

Security Groups : 
--> Security Groups are stateful (Need to takes care about inbound rules)
--> Default SG available for all VPCs in all Regions.
--> Changes to SG takes effect immediately, No need to stop/start/reboot..

ENI : Elastic Network Interface : EC2 : 


Task : Launch a windows ec2 instance and make it webserver. Add Additional NIC cards and test the output using multiple Private IP addresses.

Launch additional EC2 instance, and test the Webserver using multiple private IP addresses, and website delivery should limit to this instance only.

EC2 : Elastic Compute Cloud.. 

Elastically	CPU		AWS Cloud Service EC2

--> Launch Instances

AWS = Instance
Azure = Azure VM
VMware = VM / Virtual Machene
GCP = Engine
On-Prem = Box / Blade / Tower

Server = IT Manager = Future Analysis = Configuration =Acco/Purchasing Dept.. = Send Qupote Vendors = Dell --> Couple of meetings --> Finalise the price --> Release P.O along with 100% Advance --> 4 Weeks Delivery -->

When using EC2, No need to predict future usage.. 

capital expenditure: Guess all the future use and build.. ROI not immedete.. 
Operational expenditure: Cost to manage the resources.. 

Need a Server : 

On-Demand Instances : 
Reserved Instances : 
Spot Instances : 

Tenancy Model : 
Shared tenancy
Dedicated tenancy

How to launch our first Instance (Windows)

On-Demand EC2 Instances : When we don't have idea on workloads.. No PRedictable usage.. If you want to test your application for the first time.. 
Pricing : /Sec billing (With Min of 60 Sec)

Reserved Instances : Predictable usage.. Stable workloads.. We will get these instance for the duration of 1 Year / 3 Years.. In contract with AWS.. 

	--> Standard RI : We cannot change the configuration.. 
	--> Convertable RI : We can change the configuration.. 
	--> Scheduled RI : Repeaded / Persistant usage.. 

Pricing : --> Full Upfront : 100% while purchasing instance
	  --> Partial Upfront : Pay 30-50% now.. Remaining Monthly basis.. 
	  --> No Upfront : No need to pay anything now.. Pay Monthly basis.. 

Spot Instances : If our application have flexible start and stop times, We can go with spot instances.. We can get high configuration servers at low cost.. 

1 Hr 30 Min : If price increased, AWS terminates the instance and we will get charged for full/completed hours, not for partial hours.. : 1 Hr.. 

1 Hr 30 Min : If price not increased, you terminates the instance and we will get charged for full duration, Included partial hours also.. : 1 Hr 30 Min.. 

We can use Pricing history, We can create a spot fleet also.. 


How to Launch an EC2 Instance..!!!

Step 1 : CHoose an AMI (An AMI is a template that contains the software configuration (operating system, application server, and applications) required to launch your instance.)

Os : Linux (Amazon Linux, Ubuntu, Redhat, Fedora, CentoS, Kali linux), Windows (2019,2016,2012/ 2012 r2)

Step 2 : Choose the Instance Type (Choosing the configuration : vCPU, Memory, Network)

General Purpose : Stable performance for all resources 	: t2, t3, m5, m5d
Compute optimized : Gives best Compute CPU power 	: C4, C5, C5d
GPU instances : Graphic utilisation 			: P2, g4dn
Memory optimized : More RAM/Memory performance		: r4, r5, r5a, r5ad, x1
Storage optimized : Disk performance / IOPS 		: i2, i3, d2

c5.2xlarge	--> 8vCPU and 16 RAM, Up to 10 Gigabit

T2.micro --> Only instance comes under free tier eligibility



Windows : RDP : Remote Desktop Protocol : 3389 : 0.0.0.0/0
Linux : SSH : Secure shell : 22 : 


KeyPair : 


Task : Launch a Windows ec2 instance (Choose t2.micro)

Task 2 : Change the Default password, and try to login using the keypair generated password and changed password. Test which one is working. 

Task 3 : Create a new user in Windows OS and Provide remote connection permissions and try to login and verify his access. --> Provide local admin rights for newly created user.

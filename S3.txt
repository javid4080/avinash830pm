S3 : Simple Storage Service : 

--> AWS Version of Google Drive
--> We can use s3 to store the flat files.

Object Based storage : S3 : Just to store files.. We cannot install anything.. 
Block Based Storage : EBS & Instance Store.. EC2 : Designed to run the OS.. 
Network file systems : EFS : Available over network.. We can add to multiple ec2..


--> Unlimited storage
--> We can store all data in BUCKETS. 
Bucket = Folder / Directory.. With unique name..
--> S3 is Global service, Not a region specific.. 
--> Soft Limit for No of Bucket = 100
--> We store Objects in buckets.

Min Obj Size : 0 bytes..
Max Obj Size : 5 TB.. 

Bucket Name : Bucket names must comply with DNS naming standards..
--> Names must be unique
--> Min Char : 3 Char.. 
--> Max CHar : 63 Char..
--> No Capital Letter..
--> Bucket name should not start with . , Endwith . , No adjesent ..
--> Should not resemble IP Address format..


--> No Pre-Provisioning required.

Versioning:
--> Track changes happening on our files.
--> Maintains CUrrent/Latest version also, previous versions.
--> If we accidentally delete any file, we can get it back (Version:hide)
--> If we delete Latest Version of object (Version : Hide), Then only we will get Delete marker. 
--> To get object back to s3, Delete the DM..
--> When Version:SHow, Delete option will not create any Delete markers..

Cross Region Replication (CRR) / Same Region Replication (SRR):

--> If we want to maintain multiple copies of our s3 bucket data (DR/HA), in another region / same region. 
--> IF we have customers/users in another geo location/region.
--> DR / HA

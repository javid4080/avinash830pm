S3 : Simple Storage Service : 

--> AWS Version of Google Drive
--> We can use s3 to store the flat files.

Object Based storage : S3 : Just to store files.. We cannot install anything.. 
Block Based Storage : EBS & Instance Store.. EC2 : Designed to run the OS.. 
Network file systems : EFS : Available over network.. We can add to multiple ec2..


--> Unlimited storage
--> We can store all data in BUCKETS. 
Bucket = Folder / Directory.. With unique name..
--> S3 is Global service, Not a region specific.. 
--> Soft Limit for No of Bucket = 100
--> We store Objects in buckets.

Min Obj Size : 0 bytes..
Max Obj Size : 5 TB.. 

Bucket Name : Bucket names must comply with DNS naming standards..
--> Names must be unique
--> Min Char : 3 Char.. 
--> Max CHar : 63 Char..
--> No Capital Letter..
--> Bucket name should not start with . , Endwith . , No adjesent ..
--> Should not resemble IP Address format..


--> No Pre-Provisioning required.

After Creating a bucket, We need to edit the PublicAccess Settings.. 

Standard URL : https://s3.region.amazonaws.com/bucketname/objectname

Versioning:
--> Track changes happening on our files.
--> Maintains CUrrent/Latest version also, previous versions.
--> If we accidentally delete any file, we can get it back (Version:hide)
--> If we delete Latest Version of object (Version : Hide), Then only we will get Delete marker. 
--> To get object back to s3, Delete the DM..
--> When Version:SHow, Delete option will not create any Delete markers..

Cross Region Replication (CRR) / Same Region Replication (SRR):

--> If we want to maintain multiple copies of our s3 bucket data (DR/HA), in another region / same region. 
--> IF we have customers/users in another geo location/region.
--> DR / HA 


LMR/LCR : Life Cycle Management Roles : 


Static Website Hosting : 
--> Bucket name = domain name

Http Status coded: 

2XX : OK / Success
3XX : Redirection Error

Task : Configure SRR (Same region replication).. What is priority in SRR..!!!

Server access logging : Loggin option on our s3 bucket. We can store logs about this bucket in same/another bucket.
--> Applicable to only one bucket.
--> If we want to enable logging for entire S3 platform, we can use Cloudtrail option (Object Level Logging - Cloudtrail)

Object-level logging: Works with Cloudtrail service.


Encryption: 

--> In-Transit Encryption

	--> SSL / TLS

--> Server Side Encryption (SSE) / At-Rest 		(When data is in aws side)

	--> SSE - S3 (AES-256)
	--> SSE - KMS (Key Management Service) (KMS Generates and Manages the keys)
	--> SSE - C (Customer) (Customer Provides the Key and KMS manages the key)

--> Client Side Encryption

	--> Customer is responsible for this CSE.
	--> Customer can use his own encryption mechanism, before uploading data to s3.



KMS : AWS managed keys comes under Free tier eligibility

Customer managed keys : NO FREE TIER

Symmetric : A single encryption key that is used for both encrypt and decrypt operations
Asymmetric : A public and private key pair that can be used for encrypt/decrypt or sign/verify operations.


SSE - KMS
SSE - C External
HSM : Custom key store (CloudHSM)

Key administrators : Who can manage the key.. We can even allocate Key Delete option also for this key admins if required.

key usage permissions : Who can utilise this key / Who have permission to decrypt.

___

Object Lock : 
--> We need to enable this feature, whenever we are creating the bucket.
--> If you already have an existing bucket, Contact AWS to enable this feature.
--> Versioning must be enabled to use Object lock.

Governance mode : can be disabled by AWS accounts that have specific IAM permissions.
Compliance mode : cannot be disabled by any user, including the root account.

__

Transfer acceleration : We can use Edge locations to upload/download data from this bucket. (NO FREE TIER)

___

Events : 

--> SQS 
--> Lambda
--> SNS (Simple Notifications Service) : 

SNS : Service designed to deliver the notifications.. 

--> Create a TOPIC --> Add Subscribers to Topic --> use topic with S3..
